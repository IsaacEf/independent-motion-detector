# independent-motion-detector
The goal of this project is to detect independently moving objects in a scene captured by a single camera. This involves estimating sparse motion vectors, determining whether the camera itself is moving by locating its focus of expansion (foe), and identifying motion that deviates from the cameraâ€™s movement.

# How to run it
To run this program, run the command below ensuring to use the correct two images, replacing "image1" and "image2" with the appropriate file names.

```python 
draw_all("data/image1.png", "data/image2.png")
```

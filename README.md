# independent-motion-detector
The goal of this project is to detect independently moving objects in a scene captured by a single camera. This involves estimating sparse motion vectors, determining whether the camera itself is moving by locating its focus of expansion (foe), and identifying motion that deviates from the cameraâ€™s movement.
